# Flipkart-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python.

 ## Project Overview
This project delves into the world of online reviews and ratings on Flipkart to decipher user experiences and gauge product and brand quality. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning, I aim to transform raw review data into actionable insights, providing valuable information to both consumers and manufacturers.

## Objective
My primary objective is to predict whether a review is positive or negative based on the text content and associated ratings. By automating this sentiment analysis, I can streamline the review analysis process and make it prediction-ready.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn**: For model implementation, accuracy metrics, and TF-IDF vectorization.
* **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and generating word clouds.
* **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization capabilities.
* **NLTK**: For text analysis and stopwords removal.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises user reviews and ratings from Flipkart, serving as the foundation for my sentiment analysis model. The objective is to classify reviews as positive (numerical value = 1) or negative (numerical value = 0) to facilitate easy understanding and interpretation.

# Methodology

## Data Preprocessing
* **Text Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, lowercasing, etc.
* **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
* **Stopwords Removal**: Eliminating common words that do not carry significant meaning.

## Model Selection
I experimented with various Machine Learning algorithms and found that the Decision Tree Classifier performed exceptionally well with this dataset.

## Future Scope
As part of future enhancements, I plan to:

* **Scraping**: Incorporate web scraping techniques to gather larger datasets directly from the Flipkart website.
* **Advanced Models**: Explore and implement more sophisticated Machine Learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time review analysis and visualization.

# Conclusion
The **Decision Tree Classifier** emerges as a robust solution for sentiment analysis of Flipkart reviews, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. With the potential to scale my approach and incorporate advanced features, this project paves the way for more comprehensive and insightful review analysis in the future.
